Thoughts on API, namespaces etc. for final nmrtools library:

some natural divisions:
nmrtools.qm for QM calculations. Currently this is second-order normal spectra.
Looking ahead: if QM DNMR is implemented, where does it belong?

nmrtools.firstorder for first-order calculations
nmrtools.partial for partial solutions? Thinking eg. of the ABX that assumes X
is far away in chemical shift, AAXX that only shows A, etc.
nmrtools.dnmr for dynamic nmr simulations
nmrtools.plt for plotting utilities
