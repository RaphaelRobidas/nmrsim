Thoughts on API, namespaces etc. for final nmrtools library:

some natural divisions:
nmrtools.qm for QM calculations. Currently this is second-order normal spectra.
Looking ahead: if QM DNMR is implemented, where does it belong?

nmrtools.firstorder for first-order calculations
nmrtools.partial for partial solutions? Thinking eg. of the ABX that assumes X
is far away in chemical shift, AAXX that only shows A, etc.
nmrtools.dnmr for dynamic nmr simulations
nmrtools.plt for plotting utilities

Some OOP to make user-friendly classes? e.g.:
    SpinSystem: holds v/J data inputs and spectrum/lineshape results
    Spectrum: holds multiple spin system results (note: spectrometer frequency would have to be identical across the
    spin systems).

Consider an easy toggle for first- vs. second-order spinsystem calculations. The same v, J inputs could be used either
for a qm calculation, or a first-order interpretation.

Consistent names for various data types?

peak = (v, I) -- signal?
peaklist = [peak...]
lineshape = [[x...], [y...]]
and not spectrum = ""?

Spectrum composed from Multiplets and SpinSystems
SpinSystems has a toggle for first or second order


There is a mixture of 2D array-like forms for peaklists. Should there be one consistent form?
[(v, I)...] allows use of zip, e.g. x, y = zip(*peaklist). Pro: non-numpy users can construct these from scratch if
they wish.
np.array [[v, I]...] allows x, y = peaklist.T.
