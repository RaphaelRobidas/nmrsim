TODOs for API/documentation.

Consistent names for various data types? Create a glossary?

peak = (v, I) -- signal?
peaklist = [peak...]
lineshape = [[x...], [y...]]
and not spectrum = ""?

There is a mixture of 2D array-like forms for peaklists. Define a spec (e.g.
"2D array-like"?
[(v, I)...] allows use of zip, e.g. x, y = zip(*peaklist). Pro: non-numpy users can construct these from scratch if
they wish.
np.array [[v, I]...] allows x, y = peaklist.T.
