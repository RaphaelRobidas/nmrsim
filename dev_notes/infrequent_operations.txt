This is a list of infrequent tasks, so that I remember how to perform them.

If 'make html' isn't working for some reason, do this from the
'docs' directory:
    sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/ ../nmrsim/

When using pipenv, matplotlib on OSX gives an error. The solution is to edit the
 matplotlib configuration so as not to use the Mac backend, but TkAgg:

Exporting conda env to a .yml:

    conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml

interactive ipywidgets not appearing in Jupyter:

    jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager

    this may require:
        conda install nodejs
    and may also require an npm install.

virtual environments:
    python -m venv venv  # second venv is name of dir
    source venv/bin/activate (linux/macOS), or
    venv\Scripts\activate.bat (Windows CLI)
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    then test
    deactivate  # when done

Installing the venv with an Anaconda install on Windows was problematic. Seemed
to get it to work by using the Anaconda Prompt (not cli), then creating the
venv from the base conda Python.
    (venv) (base) {path}> pip install x

testpypi:
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    (twine check dist/*)  (checks the readme)
    twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
    (in new environment)
    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ nmrsim
First attempt: needed to pip install sparse and matplotlib first. all tests
initially passed in new env/clone, but when 'nmrsim' folder renamed, some tests
failed. Reason seems to be the bin folder was not included--so need to edit
setup.py. also build/lib indicates the jupyter folder with __init__ was copied
over as well! need to ingore it.
