The sparse .npz files seem to work across platforms and python versions. However, ideally should
work out how to do parametrized testing and builds. Maybe at some point different binaries will
be needed on different OSs or dependency versions?

Sparse 0.8.0 has a deprecation warning (actually, with numba sub-dependency),
but it appears that their devs are on this and it's in the process of being fixed (2019-11-08)

env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numba/types/containers.py:3
  /Users/geoffreysametz/Documents/testing/nmrsim/env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numba/types/containers.py:3:
  DeprecationWarning: Using or importing the ABCs from 'collections' instead of from 'collections.abc' is deprecated, and in 3.8 it will stop working
    from collections import Iterable
