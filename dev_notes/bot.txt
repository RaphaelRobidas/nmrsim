A list of specific actions to do when publishing the package. Ideally this can all be automated.

Plan: a push to develop will trigger a testpypi update. It will not trigger a ReadtheDocs update.
A push to master will trigger a pypi update and ReadtheDocs update.

With parametrized testing (python 3.6+; possibly numpy/scipy/sparse/matplotlib), and possibly
parametrized on mac vs windows vs linux:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate (or windows variant)
pip install -e ".[dev]"
(re)build .npz binaries
pytest
flake8
(bump version) * this is a tricky bit
cd docs; make html; make clean; or something like that
pip install twine wheel
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
(check for bin, no extras... check-manifest?)
twine check dist/*
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

Note: tox project uses a 'tasks' directory for useful scripts, e.g. release.py.
May be a good model.
