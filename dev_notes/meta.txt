A collection of things to consider regarding the structure and deploying of the package.

Apparently pyproject.toml is the new hotness. Implement?
PEP 440 with SemVer, and adopt a .devx suffix for develop and testpypi.
Meaning of alpha, beta will change after Version 1 released, so just use .devx in develop
branch for now.
src directory vs. the current no-src structure?
tox vs nox vs...?
Github hooks and actions?
automate develop -> testpypi and master -> pypi

Need to grok universal wheels and building on multiple systems/pythons.
In particular: It is probably a good idea to have creation of the .npz binaries as part of the
build/packaging process, in case there are differences between OSs and dependency versions.
This will make building a slow process, but with automation hopefully only needs to be done
once per push to master (or possibly develop).

Look into ways to programmatically run, test, clear output and save Jupyter notebooks.
Also consider either removing top-level jupyter folder, or using notebook linking so they're
not duplicated in two different places, in two styles (one no output for sphinx, one with
output for github) and with different import paths.
