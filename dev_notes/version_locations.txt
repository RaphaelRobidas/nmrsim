Until a version number managing scheme is implemented: here is a list of places
where a version number is found (ignoring build folders). Includes examples of
surrounding context (v vs version, alpha/beta, etc).

a.b.c format:
    top level:
        CHANGELOG.rst a.b.c
        README.rst version 0.2.0 alpha
        setup.py version="0.2.0"
    docs:
        source
            conf.py release='0.2.0-alpha'; version = '0.2'
            introduction.rst v0.2.0 (alpha)

    nmrsim:
        __init__ __version__ = '0.2.0'
Location of year:
    top level:
