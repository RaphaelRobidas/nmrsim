nmrtools
========

This repository is for consolidating the NMR libraries I've used across my projects. The long-term goal would be to create an installable library, and possibly add it to PyPI if its quality was high enough to be useful to others.

Until such an endpoint is realized, the repository will hold notebooks, testing code, and other random materials, as a personal scrapbook.
