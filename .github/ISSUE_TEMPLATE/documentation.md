**Is your request for additional documentation?**
If so, please indicate:
* what information you would like added to the documentation, 
* where you think it should be included (e.g. a section of the online documentation, or a particular docstring in the code), and 
* why it would be helpful to users.

**Is your request for a correction to the documentation?**
If so, please indicate:
* what the error is
* where the issue is found (e.g. a specific page/section of the online documentation, or the module/function/class/method containing the docstring in question).
