nmrsim
------

`nmrsim.qm`: negative frequencies seem to be "reflected" to positive (tested
with an AB2 system where va is -13.25 Hz and vb x 2 is 13.25 Hz.)

docs
----
When building docs: "modules.rst... isn't included in any toctree". modules.rst and nmrsim.rst are involved with apidoc somehow... need to figure out how this works.
