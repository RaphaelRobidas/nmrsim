This is a list of infrequent tasks, so that I remember how to perform them.

If 'make html' isn't working for some reason, do this from the
'docs' directory:
    sphinx-apidoc -f -o source/ ../nmrtools/

When using pipenv, matplotlib on OSX gives an error. The solution is to edit the
 matplotlib configuration so as not to use the Mac backend, but TkAgg:

Exporting conda env to a .yml:

    conda env export --no-builds > environment.yml

interactive ipywidgets not appearing in Jupyter:

    jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager

    this may require:
        conda install nodejs
    and may also require an npm install.

virtual environments:
python -m venv venv  # second venv is name of dir
source venv/bin/activate
{when requirements/setup work}
pip install -e .
then test
deactivate  # when done

however, for windows, it seems instead of source, use from cmd.exe:
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
It then also seems that you get a (venv)(condaenvname) double reference, and
that if something (e.g. pytest) is not installed in venv then it is fetched
from conda.
BUT "conda deactivate" removed the conda env leaving only (venv), and then
it seemed to recognize only what was installed in venv

with setup.py and extras_require setup:
pip install -e ".[dev]"
