Introduction to nmrtools v0.0.1 (pre-alpha)
===========================================

**nmrtools** is a library of tools for simulating NMR spectra, starting from parameters provided by the user (e.g. chemical shift; *J* coupling constants; rate constants for DNMR spectra). Currently, the application is limited to spin-:math:`1/2` nuclei only, but expanding this to other nuclei is feasible.
