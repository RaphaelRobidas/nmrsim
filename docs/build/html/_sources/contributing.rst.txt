Contributing to **nmrtools**
----------------------------

While the project is alpha, the best way to contribute is to send feedback to
the author, either by opening an Issue or by email (sametz at udel dot edu).
This can be anything from a technical suggestion (NMR physics and code) to
documentation and user-friendliness (e.g. unclear descriptions, typos, awkward
namespace).

By the time the project goes beta, there will be developer instructions and a
Code of Conduct.

Disclaimer: the author is neither an NMR spectroscopist, nor a software
engineer. I'm figuring this out as I go along. I welcome any constructive
criticism on any aspect of the project.
