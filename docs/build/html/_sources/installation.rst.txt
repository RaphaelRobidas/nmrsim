Installation
------------
Currently, the project is an alpha version, meaning that the files must be
downloaded to a user's code directory and used there.

When the project becomes beta, there will be instructions to :code:`pip install`
the code from the downloaded code. A "release candidate" (-rc) version will
mean that the package can be installed directly from the Python Package Index
(PyPI) via :code:`pip install`.
