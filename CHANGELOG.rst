All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is inspired by `Keep a Changelog <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/>`_ and tries to adhere to `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org>`_ as well as `PEP 440 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/>`_.

Working towards a Version 1.0.0 release, the author interprets the terms below as follows:

* **pre-alpha status**: Working code, but every aspect of the project is in flux, including API and documentation.

* **alpha status**: The "broad strokes" of an API are in place. Code testing and optimization, API adjustments, addition of new features and tests, and creating packaging requirements will be ongoing.

* **beta status**: All anticipated Version 1.0.0 features are implemented and documented. The package can be installed via setup.py.

* **release candidate status**: The package can be deployed on PyPI and made pip-installable.

* **Version 1.0.0 release**: API is stable. The package is available on PyPI (and perhaps conda).
